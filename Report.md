##âœ… Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

###Q1: Explain the primary differences between TensorFlow and PyTorch. When would you choose one over the other?

TensorFlow â†’ Best for production deployment, uses static computational graphs, integrates well with mobile/edge devices (TensorFlow Lite).

PyTorch â†’ More intuitive and Pythonic, uses dynamic graphs, better for research and experimentation.

ðŸ‘‰ When to choose:

Use TensorFlow for scalable production systems.

Use PyTorch for flexible prototyping & academic research.

###Q2: Describe two use cases for Jupyter Notebooks in AI development.

Interactive Prototyping â†’ Test and visualize ML models step by step in an interactive environment.

Documentation + Code â†’ Combine explanations, code, and visualizations in one shareable format.

Q3: How does spaCy enhance NLP tasks compared to basic Python string operations?

spaCy provides pre-trained NLP models that perform tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and Named Entity Recognition (NER) automatically.

Basic Python string operations can only do simple text manipulation, not advanced NLP tasks.

Comparative Analysis: Scikit-learn vs TensorFlow

Feature	Scikit-learn	TensorFlow
Target Applications	Classical ML (Decision Trees, SVM, etc.)	Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs)
Ease of Use	Very beginner-friendly	Slightly steeper learning curve
Community Support	Large, well-documented for ML	Huge support, especially for deep learning

âœ… Part 2: Practical Implementation
Task 1: Iris Classification with Decision Tree
Goal: Classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

Steps: Loaded dataset, visualized sepal/petal features, trained Decision Tree, evaluated metrics

Result: Achieved 100% Accuracy, Precision, and Recall

ðŸ‘‰ Full code and outputs are available in the notebook.

Task 2: MNIST CNN Classification
Goal: Classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) using a CNN

Steps: Built CNN with Conv2D â†’ MaxPooling â†’ Dense layers, trained for 3 epochs, evaluated accuracy

Result: Achieved >95% Test Accuracy

ðŸ‘‰ Full code and outputs are available in the notebook.

Task 3: NLP with spaCy
Goal: Extract product names & brands, analyze sentiment in a product review

Steps: Processed text with spaCy â†’ Extracted entities â†’ Used rule-based sentiment scoring

Result: Detected Apple iPhone 14 (PRODUCT) and Amazon (ORG) â†’ Sentiment: Positive

ðŸ‘‰ Full code and outputs are available in the notebook.

âœ… Part 3: Ethical Reflection & Optimization
Bias in Data:

MNIST lacks handwriting diversity beyond simple digits.

Rule-based sentiment can misinterpret sarcasm, slang, or cultural context.

Mitigation Strategies:

Use larger, diverse datasets and data augmentation.

Apply TensorFlow Fairness Indicators for bias detection.

For NLP, use transformer models like BERT for better context understanding.

Optimization:

CNN can be improved with hyperparameter tuning & dropout layers.

Sentiment analysis can be enhanced with pre-trained sentiment models.

âœ… Summary
This assignment demonstrated:
âœ… Classical ML (Decision Tree) on structured data
âœ… Deep Learning (CNN) for image classification
âœ… NLP (spaCy) for text analysis

All code, outputs, and results are documented within the Colab notebook. Ethical considerations and optimization strategies were also discussed.
