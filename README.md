# 🧠 Mastering the AI Toolkit – AI Tools and Applications  

## 📌 Overview  

This project demonstrates the use of **popular AI frameworks and tools** through three key tasks:  

1️⃣ **Task 1 – Classical Machine Learning with Scikit-learn**  
   - Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** to classify iris flowers based on sepal and petal measurements.  

2️⃣ **Task 2 – Deep Learning with TensorFlow**  
   - Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**.  

3️⃣ **Task 3 – NLP with spaCy**  
   - Performed **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** on product reviews to extract product names and brands.  
   - Applied a **rule-based sentiment analysis** to determine if a review is **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.  

This assignment showcases AI capabilities in **classical ML, deep learning, and NLP**, along with **ethical considerations and optimization techniques**.

## 🚀 How to Run  

1. **Clone or download** this repository:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI_Tools_Assignment.git
   cd AI_Tools_Assignment
Open the AI_Tools_Assignment.ipynb notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Run each section in order:

✅ Task 1: Iris Classification

✅ Task 2: MNIST CNN Classification

✅ Task 3: NLP with spaCy (NER + Sentiment)

📊 Results
Task 1:

Decision Tree Classifier achieved 100% Accuracy, Precision, and Recall on the Iris dataset.

Confusion matrix confirmed perfect classification.

Task 2:

CNN model achieved >95% Test Accuracy on MNIST handwritten digit classification.

Correctly predicted sample handwritten digits.

Task 3:

spaCy extracted named entities like Apple iPhone 14 → PRODUCT, Amazon → ORG.

Rule-based sentiment analysis correctly classified the sample review as Positive.

✅ Ethical Considerations & Optimization
🔎 Bias in Data
MNIST is balanced but lacks handwriting diversity.

Rule-based sentiment analysis may misinterpret slang or sarcasm.

🛡️ Mitigation Strategies
Use larger, diverse datasets and data augmentation.

Apply TensorFlow Fairness Indicators for bias detection.

For NLP, leverage transformer models like BERT for better context understanding.

⚡ Optimization
Hyperparameter tuning & dropout layers for CNN.

Fine-tuned NLP models for better accuracy.
